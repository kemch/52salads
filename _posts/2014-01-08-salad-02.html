<h4>Dressing</h4>
<ul>
	<li>6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Salad</h4>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 pound cooked shrimp, peeled and de-veined</li>
	<li>1 cup quinoa, rinsed (or pre-washed)</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1 red bell pepper, cored and cut into thin bite-sized strips</li>
	<li>1 carrot, peeled and shredded</li>
	<li>1 small cucumber, peeled, seeded and finely diced</li>
	<li>2 scallions, finely chopped</li>
	<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
</ul>

<p>1. Add quinoa, salt and 1-2/3 cups water to a saucepan. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes, until the water is absorbed and quinoa is cooked. Let cool</p>

<p>2. Combine the lime juice, fish sauce, vegetable oil, sugar and crushed red pepper flakes in a bowl. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Add shrimp to the dressing and let marinate until ready to assemble the salad.

<p>3. Once quinoa is cool, add red bell pepper, carrot, cucumber and scallions to the bowl. Right before serving, add the dressing, shrimp and cilantro and toss well. Taste and adjust seasonings.</p>
