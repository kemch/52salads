<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul><li>4 medium beets, cooked and cubed</li>
<li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts</li>
<li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
<li>1 (10 ounce) package mixed baby salad greens</li>
<li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
<li>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>2 ounces goat cheese</li></ul>

<p> Place the walnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat. Heat until warm and starting to toast, then stir in the maple syrup. Cook and stir until evenly coated, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice concentrate, balsamic vinegar and olive oil to make the dressing.
</p>
<p>Place a large helping of baby greens onto each of four salad plates, divide candied walnuts equally and sprinkle over the greens. Place equal amounts of beets over the greens, and top with dabs of goat cheese. Drizzle each plate with some of the dressing.</p>
